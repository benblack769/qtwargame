Super cool game of my own design (it started out as a board game) written in c++ using the QT framework. Install QT 5.5 and run qmake or open the .pro file in QTCreator and you should be good to go.

Runs an experemental AI which is partially implemented, very buggy and very cool. The most recent version is in psuedo code in the AI_Descrip.txt.

Having the Debug_Macro_Moves #defined in globalinfo.h allows you to veiw the data that the AI is using to make descisions.
